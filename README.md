#### Helping spread communication about novel virus Covid19 via FREE text messages for everyone.
Covid Helpline is a **open source tool** created to raise awareness and boost communication about the current coronavirus outbreak. This is done by making the latest updated data obtained from *John Hopkins*’ open source  *COVID-19* data repository available to everyone online and offline.

## Getting Started

* Text the desired **country name** *or* **state/province name** to the designated twilio phone number to receive the latest updated data from [John Hopkins' open source repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) about the number of *confirmed cases*, *deaths*, and *recoveries* in that location.
* Text **"News"** *or* **"Updates"** to get the latest news articles about Coronavirus from a truthful source:  [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
* Text **"Tips"** *or* **"Help"** to get CDC best advice about how to stay safe during the pandemic.
* Text anything else to receive the generic helper SMS with the all above options.

# Why is this important?
**The biggest issue about pandemics is communication.** As of today, 10% of the U.S population does not use the internet. 42% of older adults are part of that group. The vast majority of Americans – 96% – now own a cellphone of some kind. Of that 96% of Americans only 81% owned a smartphone. We also have 91% of Americans age 65+, who own some type cellphone, of that share 39% of the group do not own a smartphone. Still, these numbers are more extremes in developing countries.

These stats are extremely important; People at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 are older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. According to early CDC data, it is suggested that older people are twice as likely to have serious COVID-19 illness.

Making this information accessible via text, along with the latest Coronavirus news, and the CDC advice about how to stay safe would greatly aid mankind in it's quest to control this fatal virus. Covid Helpline is a *reasonably easy and cheap solution* to this issue.
